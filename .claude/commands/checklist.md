Create a checklist for what I describe:

Requirements:
- Each item should be a specific, completable action
- Start each item with a verb
- Order logically (dependencies first)
- Group into phases if more than 10 items
- Include any "don't forget" items that are commonly missed

Format as markdown checkboxes: - [ ] Item
