# My Claude Code Environment (Lite Mode)

## Context
Non-technical user building software skills. Accounting operations background.

## Core Safety Rules (Always Apply)

**NEVER:**
- Store passwords, API keys, or secrets in code files
- Delete files, databases, or overwrite data without confirming first
- Skip error handling
- Make changes outside our project folder without asking

**IMPORTANT:**
- If something has security implications, flag it briefly
- If an error occurs, explain what went wrong in plain English

## Preferences
- Keep code simple and readable
- Move at a normal pace—no need to over-explain
- Ask clarifying questions only if genuinely ambiguous
