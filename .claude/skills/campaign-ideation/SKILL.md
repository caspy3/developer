# Campaign Ideation Skill

## Purpose
Generate multiple creative campaign concepts that solve the brief's challenge in unexpected, memorable ways.

## Ideation Process

### Phase 1: Diverge
Generate as many ideas as possible without judgment:
- Quantity over quality initially
- Build on others' ideas
- Challenge assumptions
- Explore extremes

### Phase 2: Evaluate
Apply filters to narrow down:
- Does it solve the brief?
- Is it distinctive?
- Is it executable?
- Is it extendable?

### Phase 3: Develop
Flesh out the strongest concepts:
- Define the big idea
- Map executions across channels
- Identify potential obstacles
- Refine the narrative

## Campaign Concept Format

## Idea Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Question | Weight |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **On Brief** | Does it solve the problem? | High |
| **Original** | Is it different from competitors? | High |
| **Memorable** | Will people remember it? | High |
| **Executable** | Can we actually make it? | Medium |
| **Scalable** | Does it work across channels? | Medium |
| **Timely** | Is it culturally relevant? | Medium |

## Ideation Techniques
1. **What If**: Challenge every assumption
2. **Opposite World**: Do the reverse of convention
3. **Mashup**: Combine unrelated concepts
4. **Constraint Flip**: Turn limitations into features
5. **Audience Swap**: Design for a different audience, then adapt
