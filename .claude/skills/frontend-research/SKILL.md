This skill guides reverse engineering of front-end designs from live websites. The goal is capturing the design philosophy and signature elements needed to recreate a similar vibe - not pixel-perfect replication.

## Step 1: Holistic Understanding

Before documenting anything, understand the design completely:

- **Brand Context**: What is this company/product? Who is their audience?
- **Aesthetic Classification**: What design tradition? (minimalist, brutalist, editorial, luxury, playful, corporate, etc.)
- **Signature Elements**: What makes this design memorable? What's the signature move?
- **Emotional Impact**: How does it make you feel? What mood does it create?

**CRITICAL**: Look beyond surface elements. Identify the underlying system and intentionality. A great analysis reveals the "why" behind every "what."

## Step 2: Design Brief Output

Deliver a narrative design brief covering:

### Design Philosophy
Describe the core design approach in 2-3 paragraphs. What rules does this design follow? What principles guide it? Why do the choices work together? Include comparable references ("Similar to Apple's minimal approach but with more warmth").

### Signature Elements
List 3-5 distinctive features that define this design's identity. These are the elements you MUST capture to recreate the vibe. Be specific about what makes each element distinctive.

### Visual System Summary

**Typography**: Describe the type personality - is it bold and commanding or refined and subtle? Note the hierarchy approach, key font characteristics, and how type creates mood.

**Color**: Describe the palette strategy - is it monochromatic, high-contrast, muted, vibrant? What emotions do the colors evoke? Note primary, accent, and background relationships.

**Spacing & Layout**: Describe the spatial philosophy - generous whitespace or dense information? How does the grid feel? What creates rhythm and breathing room?

**Motion & Interaction**: Describe the animation personality - snappy, smooth, playful, subtle? What micro-interactions stand out?

### Recreation Priorities
Ranked list of what matters most when recreating this design. What should you nail first? What can be approximated? What details are essential vs. nice-to-have?

## Quality Standards

- Capture the essence, not every detail
- Explain WHY choices work, not just WHAT they are
- Be specific enough to guide implementation
- Focus on what makes this design THIS design
- The brief should enable recreating the vibe without seeing the original
