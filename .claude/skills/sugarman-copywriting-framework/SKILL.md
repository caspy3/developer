# Sugarman Copywriting Framework

## The Slippery Slide

Every element of copy has one purpose: compel the reader to read the next sentence.

- **First sentence**: Short, compelling, impossible to ignore
- **Second sentence**: Builds on the first, pulls reader deeper
- **Every element**: Headlines, subheads, captions—all entry points to the slide

## Psychological Triggers

1. **Feeling of Involvement**: Make the reader mentally own the product
2. **Honesty**: Acknowledge flaws to build trust
3. **Integrity**: Deliver on every promise made
4. **Credibility**: Use specifics, not generalities
5. **Value Justification**: Explain why the price is worth it
6. **Resolve Objections**: Address doubts before they form
7. **Curiosity**: Plant seeds that demand answers
8. **Storytelling**: Wrap selling points in narrative
9. **Authority**: Establish expertise naturally
10. **Proof of Value**: Demonstrate, don't just claim

## Copy Structure

1. **Environment**: Set the buying mood before selling
2. **Concept**: Sell the idea, not the product features
3. **Incubation**: Let complex ideas breathe
4. **Linking**: Connect new concepts to familiar ones
5. **Specificity**: "3,247 customers" beats "thousands of customers"

## The Editing Process

- Cut ruthlessly—if it doesn't pull forward, it pushes away
- Read aloud—awkward sentences break the slide
- Test assumptions—what you find clever, readers may find confusing
