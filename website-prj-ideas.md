1. **Typing Speed Racer**

	- **The Pitch:** A paragraph of text appears. The user types it as fast as possible. The game highlights errors in red and calculates Words Per Minute (WPM) at the end.
    
	- **Why for Ralph:** It deals with "events" (every keystroke matters) and comparing strings of text.
    
	- **Portfolio Value:** Highly shareable ("I just got 90 WPM on [Your Name]'s site").

2. **A "Decision Spinner" Wheel**

	- **The Pitch:** User inputs a list of options (e.g., "Tacos", "Pizza", "Salad"). They click "Spin," and a visual wheel spins and lands on one.
    
	- **Why for Ralph:** It combines randomness logic with CSS animations (spinning the wheel).
    
	- **Portfolio Value:** A fun, chaotic tool that people actually use.

3. **Memory Match Card Game**

	- **The Pitch:** A grid of face-down cards. You click two; if they match, they stay up. If not, they flip back.
    
	- **Why for Ralph:** It tests "array logic" (tracking which cards are where) and simple animations (flipping).
    
	- **Portfolio Value:** Fun, interactive, and easy to skin with custom images (maybe icons of things you like).

4. **A "Compound Interest" Calculator**

	- **The Pitch:** User inputs a starting amount, monthly contribution, and interest rate; the app shows a graph or chart of how much money they'll have in 30 years.
    
	- **Why for Ralph:** Great for testing math logic and generating visual charts (e.g., using a library like Chart.js).
    
	- **Portfolio Value:** Shows you can handle data visualization.
